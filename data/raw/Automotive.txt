review/summary: Great buy!
review/text: I purchased a different jacket when I first got my motorcycle, but I only used it for about six months before needing a new one. In my local shop, they had no plus-sized women's jackets, so I was wearing a men's jacket, and the plates weren't in good places to be protective in case of an accident. This jacket runs true to size, and seems more durable than the other brand of jacket I had (Joe Rocket). The two separate zip-out liners are very convenient and easy. I am very happy with the fit and quality. I ride about two hours a day, on the interstate, and my old jacket started to fray at certain seams after only a month or so. I have had this one for over a month, and there are no signs of wear. In addition, the jacket is comfortable from 95 degrees down to 50 degrees (with appropriate clothing underneath, of course). It may work in even colder weather, but I haven't ridden in anything colder than 50. Overall, I'm really, really pleased with this purchase!

review/summary: Great jacket for the money
review/text: This jacket met every expectation and more. Although heavy, it is comfortable and can be snugged down for a more "tailored" fit. If anything could be a "con" its the zippers...when the linings are out, there are a lot of zippers exposed and I often try to zip the wrong ones! The liners are great....keep you dry, keep off the wind, or keep you warm. I have no complaints. The jacket may be short for some people...but I'm very short-waisted and it fits me perfect. I sized up 1 size and it is quite comfortable.

review/text: This is a cute little kit that doesn't take up a lot of space, but it has everything you might need in case of an car accident. This would make a great gift for someone who has just gotten their first car.
